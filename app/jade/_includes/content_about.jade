        h1 "БЮРО" is "Bureau" in Cyrillic
    p
        | The design of the Cyrillic alphabet is pretty neat in that, most of the time, the letters are pronounced only one way. Cyrillic script is very close to being phonetic. It also makes for beautiful shapes and interesting typography.
    p
        | This balance between functional design and aesthetic is a good illustration of what Experience Bureau is about.

        h1 "Ю" = "You"
    p Well sort of...
    p
        | The "Ю" character in "БЮРО" makes the sound "You". In the context of a website or application, "You" is normally the user - the most important person to consider.
